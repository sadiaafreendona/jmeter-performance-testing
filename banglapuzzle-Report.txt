200 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 0.72 And Total Concurrent API requested: 800.
300 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 0.88 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1200.
310 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 0.90 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1240.


While executed 320 concurrent requests, it shows errors but cmd prompt fails to show all results due to server error !

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 310 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
